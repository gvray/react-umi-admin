## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- Corepack (bundled with Node.js)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the Project

```bash
# Default dev environment (with built-in Mock data)
pnpm start

# Dev environment (with built-in Mock data)
pnpm start:dev

# Staging environment (connected to gvray-admin backend) — recommended
pnpm start:staging

# Production environment
pnpm start:prod
```

### Test Accounts

| Environment | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mock (`pnpm start` / `pnpm start:dev`) | `admin` | `123456` |
| Staging (`pnpm start:staging`) | See backend seed data | See backend seed data |

> 💡 It is recommended to start the **gvray-admin** backend first, then use the `staging` environment to experience the full feature set.

For more configuration, see:

- `.env.dev`
- `.env.staging`
- `.env.prod`
